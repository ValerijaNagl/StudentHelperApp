# StudentHelperApp
-This is a school project/android application whose main task is to ilustrate how to fetch data from API and save it in local database and also how to work with localbase. 

-Tehnologies used in project: MVV pattern; on presentation layer I used ViewModel and LiveData. LiveData stores states of data structures. User's info is stored in SharedPreferances.  All data are delivered and saved in repository (whose location is data layer). Room is used for communication with database. Retrofit is used for communication with server. CustomView is user for drawing a graph.
